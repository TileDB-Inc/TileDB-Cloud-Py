# NOTE: we cannot use an __init__.py file in the tiledb/ directory, because it is supplied
#       by core tiledb-py. Therefore, `find_packages` at the root directory does not find
#       any sub-packages. We must explicitly iterate the `tiledb/cloud` subdirectory

# 2) https://stackoverflow.com/a/53486554
# Note: we also exclude `namespace_packages` argument, because it causes creation of the
#       '[].nspkg.pth' pointer file, which breaks imports of tiledb.cloud.
