    A DelayedGraph is an all-in-one wrapper over the graph pre-building (using
    delayed Nodes), main building (using the Builder), and execution phases of
    DAG management. It allows users to build task graphs from delayed Nodes
    without their having to worry about the DAG instances themselves, by
    automatically managing graph structure and unifying nodes into a single
    DelayedGraph as previously-independent Nodes merge together.

    A DelayedGraph has two primary overall states: graph construction (where
    the graph's structure can be added to and changed) and execution (where the
    structure of the graph is finalized, it is built, and handed off to an
    Executor to be run).

    While the graph-construction process is *not* thread-safe, after the graph
    starts execution, all execution-lifecycleâ€“related methods *are* thread-safe.

    Users are not expected to ever deal with DelayedGraph instances manully;
    the complete user-facing API is exposed in Node.
