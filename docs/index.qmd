Welcome to TileDB's Cloud [Python client](https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-Cloud-Py/).<br>
This client offers programmatic access to [TileDB Cloud](https://docs.tiledb.com/cloud).

# Installation

You can install the Cloud-Py SDK client as follows:

```python
pip install tiledb-cloud
```

While the preferred method of running code samples and notebooks in this section is directly within TileDB Cloud (as all dependencies are installed for you), you can run most of the code samples and notebooks in this section locally. To run these code samples and notebooks locally, install the following dependencies:

```python
pip install ipykernel jupyterlab graphviz
pip install tiledb-cloud[all]
```

For Life Science capabilities:

```python
pip install tiledb-cloud[life-sciences]
```
