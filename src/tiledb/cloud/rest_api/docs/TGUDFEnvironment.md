Neither this nor &#x60;language&#x60; needs to be set for registered UDFs, since the language and version are stored server-side with the UDF itself.                                                                                                                                                  | [optional] |

Resource classes define resource limits for memory and CPUs. If this is empty, then the UDF will execute in the standard resource class of the TileDB Cloud provider.                                                                                                                                | [optional] |

Registered UDFs and functions which take arrays as inputs can never be executed client-side. If the client’s environment is incompatible, or the client does not support client-side execution, the function will be executed on the server. | [optional] |
| **timeout**                 | **float**                                                     | The maximum length of time this UDF is allowed to execute for before it is killed and fails. If not present (or zero), the function is allowed to run indefinitely (subject to the server’s global limits).                                                                                                                                           | [optional] |
